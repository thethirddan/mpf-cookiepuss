RE Randomizing songs: 
Anthony van Winkle
AudiostreamRandomizer counts as a sound asset so it can be played from sound player just like any other sound

Dan Baumfeld
so would I create a slide that only contains AudiostreamRandomizer in godot, and start and stop it as needed? 
or are you talking about another way to do this?

Anthony van Winkle
Create a new Resource of type AudioStreamRandomizer and save it as a file in your sound folder, 
then use that file name to play it from sound player

RE sound on slides:
Anthony van Winkle
Yes, the best way to manage music is with sound_player. Slide priority does stack them correctly, 
but the lower-priority slides still exist in the scene tree so any behavior they have (like playing music) will still be in effect.
(Though it would probably be worth adding some callback methods on the slide class for when it changes state, 
e.g. becomes active or inactive. Not for this case, but maybe some other cases)

I do the music in the mode configs
You can also have a game_wide mode to handle music, that starts and stops with ball, and then has start and stops for all the audio
